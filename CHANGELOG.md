# Changelog

All notable changes to the Game-Changing Translator project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [3.9.0] - 2025-10-23

### Added
- **Input Field Translation**: A new feature that allows for in-place translation of text within any application's input fields.
  - **Activation**: Enabled via a checkbox in the Settings tab.
  - **Floating Icon**: When a text input field is clicked, a floating translation icon appears next to it.
  - **Click-to-Translate**: Clicking the icon copies the text from the input field, translates it, and pastes the translated text back, replacing the original.
  - **Undo Functionality**: After a translation, a temporary `Ctrl+Z` hotkey is registered for 5 seconds, allowing the user to revert the text to its original state.

## [3.8.0] - 2025-10-23

### Added
- **Hover Translation Mode**: A new interaction mode that allows users to translate text on-demand by simply hovering their mouse over a source area.
  - **Enable/Disable**: Can be toggled via a checkbox in the Settings tab.
  - **Configurable Delay**: A "Hover Delay" slider allows users to set the time (in milliseconds) the mouse must remain still before a translation is triggered, preventing accidental captures.
  - **Synchronous Translation**: This mode uses a separate, synchronous (blocking) translation path to ensure immediate feedback upon hover, bypassing the standard asynchronous queue.
- **Click-Through Overlays**: Added a "Toggle Click-through" button on the main tab, which makes all overlay windows (source and target) transparent to mouse events.
  - This allows users to interact with underlying game or application elements without moving the overlays.
  - This feature is Windows-only and utilizes the `pywin32` library to modify window styles.
- **Right-Click Context Menu**: A context menu has been added to the translation overlay, accessible via a right-click.
  - **Copy**: Copies the currently displayed translation to the clipboard using `pyperclip`.
  - **Read Aloud**: Uses a text-to-speech engine (`pyttsx3`) to read the translated text aloud.
  - The menu items are disabled if there is no text in the overlay.

## [3.7.0] - 2025-10-04

### Added
- **DeepL Translation Context Window Support**: Enhanced DeepL translation with context awareness for improved grammar and meaning
  - Configurable context window supporting up to 3 previous subtitles for narrative coherence
  - Context usage does not count towards DeepL's free translation character limit
  - Dedicated detailed logging system in `DeepL_Translation_Long_Log.txt` file for complete translation tracking
  - Context window improves pronoun resolution and grammatical agreement between consecutive subtitles
- **Updated Gemini Model Support**: Added latest Gemini models with improved performance characteristics
  - Gemini 2.5 Flash (gemini-2.5-flash-preview-09-2025) with good translation quality and lower latency
  - Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite (gemini-2.5-flash-lite-preview-09-2025) optimised for OCR with reduced latency
  - Gemini 2.0 Flash remains slightly better for translation quality with more than six times lower output cost than Gemini 2.5 Flash
- **Experimental Line Break Preservation**: Optional feature to maintain original line breaks in OCR and translation output
  - Works best with Gemini models for consistent line break handling
  - Less consistent results with GPT models and DeepL
  - Recommended to keep disabled for most scenarios but helpful for certain dialogue scenes without initial dashes

### Added
- N/A

### Changed
- N/A

### Fixed
- **Translation Cache Duplicate Detection Bug**: Fixed incorrect duplicate detection logic in the file cache system that was preventing translations of the same source text to different target languages from being saved
  - Previously, the cache only checked if the source text was identical, ignoring the language pair
  - Now correctly checks both the source text AND the language pair (source→target) before treating an entry as a duplicate
  - Ensures that translating the same source text to different target languages (e.g., English→French and English→Italian) are both properly saved to cache files
  - Affects all translation providers that use file caching (Gemini, Google Translate, DeepL)

### Removed
- N/A

## [3.5.5] - 2025-08-17

### Added
- Added Persian language support to the Gemini API and Google Translate translation services.
- Enhanced text display formatting for right-to-left (RTL) languages with improved punctuation positioning.

## [3.5.3] - 2025-08-13

### Added
- **Network Resilience System**: A comprehensive solution to prevent Windows network stack corruption that caused API delays to increase after extended use
  - Circuit Breaker Pattern: Automatically detects network degradation (>3s calls or failures) and forces a client refresh when issues are detected.
  - Periodic Client Refresh: Proactively refreshes the Gemini client every 30 minutes or after 100 API calls to prevent connection staleness.
  - Connection Cleanup: Scheduled maintenance every 20 minutes to clear connection pools and prevent the accumulation of stale connections.
  - DNS Cache Management: Hourly system-level DNS cache flushing (`ipconfig /flushdns`) to address Windows network stack issues.
  - This self-healing behavior eliminates the need for PC restarts to restore performance.

### Changed
- **API Logging Performance Optimization**: Eliminated an O(n) scaling issue in cumulative statistics calculation that caused increasing delays during extended use
  - Replaced file-based cumulative totals lookup with an efficient in-memory cache for OCR and translation operations.
  - Prevents log file reading overhead that grew progressively slower as usage history accumulated.
  - Maintains sub-second logging performance regardless of the application's runtime duration.

  - Restores consistent ~2-second translation performance, eliminating scenarios where delays could extend to 3+ seconds
  - Maintains proper natural rate limiting through API response times and thread pool capacity limits
- **Concurrent Call Limits Optimization**: Improved system stability and performance under load
  - Reduced maximum concurrent OCR calls from 10 to 8 for better resource management
  - Reduced maximum concurrent translation calls from 8 to 6 to prevent API saturation

  - Errors are still logged for debugging purposes but hidden from end users
  - Application continues working normally when Gemini API recovers from temporary overload

### Changed
- **Adaptive Load Balancing**: More responsive system load detection and management
  - OCR overload detection now triggers at >5 active calls instead of >7 for earlier intervention
  - Improved load recovery threshold remains at <5 active calls for stable operation
  - Enhanced system responsiveness during high API usage periods

### Added
- N/A

### Removed
- **Redundant OCR Thread Delays**: Removed unnecessary artificial sleep intervals that were compounding translation delays

## [3.5.1] - 2025-08-03
