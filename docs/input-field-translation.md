# Input Field Translation

This document describes how to use the Input Field Translation feature, which allows you to translate text directly within any text input field on your system.

## Enabling the Feature

1.  Go to the **Settings** tab in the application.
2.  Find the **Input Field Translation** section.
3.  Check the **Enable** checkbox.

Once enabled, the application will monitor for mouse clicks in text input fields.

## How to Use

1.  Click on any text input field (e.g., in a web browser, text editor, etc.). You will know it's a text field if the cursor changes to an I-beam (a vertical bar).
2.  A small "T" icon will appear next to your cursor.
3.  Click the "T" icon to translate the text currently in the input field. The text will be automatically selected, copied, translated, and the translation will be pasted back into the field, replacing the original text.

## Undoing a Translation

If you want to revert the translation back to the original text, simply press `Ctrl+Z` on your keyboard.
