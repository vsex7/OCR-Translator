# Overlay Display Modes

This document explains the three different display modes for the translation overlay.

## Overview

The application provides three distinct display modes for the translation overlay, allowing you to choose the most convenient way to view the translated text. You can switch between these modes in the "Settings" tab.

### 1. Target Only

This is the default mode. The translation appears in a separate, independent overlay window. You can freely move and resize this window.

### 2. Source + Target

In this mode, the overlay displays both the original source text and the translated text side-by-side in a two-column layout. This is useful for comparing the original and the translation. The overlay window is movable and resizable.

### 3. Overlay

This mode is designed to make the translation appear as if it's part of the original content. The translation overlay is positioned directly on top of the source OCR area, effectively covering the original text. In this mode, the overlay is not movable or resizable. The background is a semi-transparent black to ensure readability while still being able to see the content underneath.
